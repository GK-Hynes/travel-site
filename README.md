I went from knowing the basics of Git to making it part of my daily routine. 

### Mobile-first Development

* #### Custom CSS
    The site features a custom-built, responsive 12 column grid without using Bootstrap. 

* #### BEM
    Super organized CSS using the BEM methodology. 

* #### Flexbox

### Automating build tasks with Gulp
I used Gulp to automate everything. SVG sprites. imagemin

### Organized, modern JavaScript
Super organized, modular, ES6 JavaScript. 

### Lazy loading 
Speed up load times and save users' data plans by only loading images when the user scrolls to that point. 

### Legacy Browser Support
