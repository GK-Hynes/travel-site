## Built with:

* Node - to automate tasks and manage packages
* Gulp - to automate build tasks
* PostCSS - to add CSS postprocessing
* Webpack - 
* Babel - 
* Flexbox - 
* Waypoints - 
* Browsersync - 

## Skills learned 

### Version Control with Git
I went from knowing the basics of Git to making it part of my daily routine, building each feature on its own branch and and regularly pushing changes to GitHub. 

### Mobile-first Development
I optimized the site from the perspective of both performance and responsiveness. 

* #### Custom CSS
    The site features a custom-built, responsive 12 column grid without using Bootstrap. 

* #### BEM
    I learned how to keep my CSS organized, maintainable, and easier to read using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology. 

* #### Flexbox

* #### Lazy loading 
    Speed up load times and save users' data plans by only loading images when the user scrolls to that point. 

### Automating build tasks with Gulp
I used Gulp to automate everything, leveraging packages such as imagemin, usemin, rev, cssnano and uglify to process my code and ensure fast loadtimes.

### Organized, modern JavaScript
Super organized, modular, ES6 JavaScript. 

### Legacy Browser Support
Despite using ES6 and Flexbox, this site will still work

### Deploying sites to GitHub Pages
